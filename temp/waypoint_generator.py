# Func:    fetch_gps_points
#
# Purpose: This script extracts GPS waypoints from a file, converts them to
#          a usable form, and sends a waypoint to ROS whenever it reaches
#          its current goal until there are not more waypoints left.

# Func:    degreesToMeters
#
# Purpose: This method takes a number of latitude/longitude degrees and
#          converts it to meters
#          
#          NOTE: This function converts the x and y coordinates separately
#
# ARGS:    y: A pointer to a GPS latitude that will be transformed into
#             meters from the latitude 
#          x: A pointer to a GPS longitude that will be transformed into
#             meters from the longitude 
#	   latitude: the current latitude Charlie is located at. This is
#		     used to correct errors in calculations due to smaller
#                    distances between longitudes as the latitude moves
#                    away from the Equator
#
# Return:  A list containing the X and Y coordinates for the next waypoint
